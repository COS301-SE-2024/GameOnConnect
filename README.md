# Byte Squad - GameOnConnect

Up until now, gamers never really had a platform for themselves. GameOnConnect solves this problem! 
Gamers will be able to connect with other gamers and will be able to share their gaming adventures with their GameOnConnect friends.

Gamers can schedule peaceful gaming sessions with their friends during which they will be able to send real-time messages in a chat room created specifically for the session.
They can also schedule competitive gaming tournaments, during which gamers will be able to send real-time messages in a chat room.
A leader-board will be displayed showing which players performed the best during the tournament.

GameOnConnect will also allow gamers to browse a multitude of games, giving them access to useful information needed to decide on their next game to play.
